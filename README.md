***Files for Miranthas MUD.***

Miranthas MUD is a continuation of tbaMUD/CircleMUD, which is built on DIKU MUD.
The code here is freeware to honor that tradition.

Due to the sensitive nature of topics found in this setting, all characters and
players are 18+. The game world is derived from several inspirational sources,
most notably the former Armageddon MUD.

Roleplay is highly encouraged, but not enforced.

Features in Miranthas MUD Alpha release:
