***Files for Dark Sun MUD.***

Dark Sun MUD is a continuation of tbaMUD/CircleMUD, which is built on DIKU MUD.
The code here is freeware to honor that tradition.

Due to the sensitive nature of topics found in this setting, all characters and
players are 18+. The game world is based on the D&D campaign setting Dark Sun
(as close as possible).

Roleplay is highly encouraged, but not enforced.

Features in Dark Sun MUD Alpha release:

* The city of Tyr is available for exploration
* Experience points and levels are removed in favor of skill based progression
* Initial skills/spells based partly on tbaMUD code and Dark Sun 5e conversion

 - [ ] Saving throws are based on 5e rules (if your class has them, you do)
 - [ ] Your spell save DC is 8 + skill profiency + ability mod for your class
