***Files for Cataclysm MUD.***

Cataclysm MUD is a continuation of tbaMUD/CircleMUD, which is built on DIKU MUD.
Due to licensing issues with tbaMUD, all licensing attributions should remain the
same and not changed from the original, pre-LGPL license model. It strives to be
open source and available to everyone just like DIKU/Circle/tba have been in the 
past. You're welcome to read the code, make your own changes in a fork, and re-use
it as need be. Just follow the LICENSE.md file and you'll be fine.


TO be clear: **this is not an LGPL licensed fork**.

Cataclysm's focus is on building an RPI MUD that takes into account many of the
failings of previous RPI games.
