establishment to enter from behind it as need be.  Carved of stone, it is
rough-hewn except on the very top, which has been polished down as much as
possible.  Chips and cracks have formed across its surface, which is beginning
to show its age.  Most of the counter is relatively clean, but certain spots are
sticky from spilled drink and food.
